--- NOTES BEGIN ---

PURPOSE: Hands-on walkthrough of all Customer Care systems to verify data inventory
compiled from Sessions 1-3. Farhan demonstrated Salesforce and Ameyo. Smita showed
Quality audit processes.

== SALESFORCE WALKTHROUGH ==

Farhan logged into Salesforce and walked through the configuration.

1. CUSTOMER RECORD STRUCTURE
   Fields visible in default Customer Care page layout:
   - Account Name (customer full name)
   - Loan Account Number
   - PAN Number [UNMASKED — full PAN visible]
   - Aadhaar Number [UNMASKED — full 12 digits visible]
   - Registered Mobile Number
   - Alternate Mobile Number
   - Email Address
   - Residential Address (full address with PIN code)
   - Loan Product Type
   - Sanctioned Loan Amount
   - Disbursed Amount
   - Current Outstanding Principal
   - Interest Rate
   - EMI Amount
   - Loan Tenure (months)
   - Next EMI Due Date
   - Account Status (Active/Closed/NPA)
   - Branch Name
   - Branch Code
   - Loan Officer Name
   - Co-Applicant Name
   - Co-Applicant PAN [UNMASKED]
   - Co-Applicant Aadhaar [UNMASKED]
   - Co-Applicant Mobile
   - Date of Birth
   - Property Address (for home loans)

   NOTE: Aadhaar was not mentioned in previous sessions. This is a CRITICAL finding.
   Full Aadhaar numbers of both primary applicant AND co-applicant are visible to ALL
   45 Customer Care staff. Aadhaar is classified as sensitive personal data. Under
   Aadhaar Act provisions, storage and display of full Aadhaar is restricted.

2. CASE MANAGEMENT
   Farhan created a test case to show the workflow:
   - Case is auto-created when agent logs a call
   - Fields: Case Number (auto), Customer Name (auto from account), Case Category
     (Query/Service Request/Customer Issue/Complaint), Sub-Category (dropdown),
     Description (free text), Priority, Status, Assigned To, Created Date, TAT Date
   - Case history tracks all status changes with timestamps
   - Email notifications sent on case creation and status change

   OBSERVATION: The Description field is free-text. Agents type anything. Reviewed a
   sample of recent cases. Some descriptions include:
     - "Customer says he is facing financial difficulty due to wife's hospitalization.
        Requested EMI moratorium."
     - "Customer alleges that LO Mr. [Name] asked for Rs 5000 as processing fee which
        was not in agreement. Customer has WhatsApp messages as proof."
     - "Customer wants to change nominee from mother to wife after recent marriage."

   These descriptions contain sensitive personal information (health situations,
   corruption allegations with named employees, family relationship changes). All
   accessible to the full Customer Care team.

3. SALESFORCE USER PROFILES
   Farhan showed the user management section. Three Salesforce profiles for CC:
   - "CC Agent" — can view/create/edit cases and customer records. Cannot delete.
   - "CC Team Lead" — same as agent plus can reassign cases and view reports.
   - "CC Manager" — full access including reports, dashboards, and user management.

   KEY ISSUE: All three profiles have IDENTICAL read access to customer records.
   There is no field-level security configured. The "CC Agent" profile sees every
   field including PAN, Aadhaar, financial data.

   Farhan confirmed he has raised this with the Salesforce admin team twice. Response
   was "we'll look into it in the next release."

4. SALESFORCE DATA EXPORT
   Asked about data export capabilities. Farhan showed that Team Lead and Manager
   profiles can export data via Salesforce reports. They can run a report on all
   customers and export to CSV.

   NOTE: No DLP controls. A team lead could export the entire customer database —
   including PAN, Aadhaar, financial data — to a CSV file on their local machine.

== AMEYO WALKTHROUGH ==

Farhan logged into the Ameyo admin panel.

1. CALL RECORDINGS
   - All inbound and outbound calls recorded
   - Recordings stored on Ameyo's cloud infrastructure (hosted by the vendor)
   - Farhan showed the recording search interface — searchable by date, agent, phone
     number, duration
   - Played back a sample recording (with customer consent data audible)
   - Recordings are in MP3 format
   - Oldest recording accessible: March 2024 (nearly 2 years)

   Asked about retention policy: Farhan said "I don't think anyone has set one. Ameyo
   just keeps everything." Checked Ameyo admin settings — no auto-deletion configured.

   STORAGE LOCATION: Farhan was unsure if Ameyo's cloud is in India or outside.
   "Their sales team said India, but I've never verified." Need to confirm with IT
   or directly with Ameyo vendor.

   NOTE: If Ameyo stores recordings outside India, this is a cross-border transfer of
   customer call recordings containing financial and personal data.

2. AMEYO-SALESFORCE INTEGRATION
   - CTI connector passes caller phone number to Salesforce for auto-lookup
   - Call metadata (duration, timestamp, agent ID, recording link) is written back to
     Salesforce on the case record
   - The recording link in Salesforce opens the recording in Ameyo's web player
   - Any Salesforce user with case access can click the link and listen to the recording

   NOTE: This means the call recordings are effectively accessible to anyone with
   Salesforce case access — not just Ameyo admins. The recording link embedded in
   the case record bypasses Ameyo's access controls.

== QUALITY AUDIT WALKTHROUGH (with Smita) ==

Smita showed the quality audit process:

1. CALL SAMPLING
   - Smita's team audits approximately 10% of total calls monthly
   - Calls are selected randomly but with weighted sampling — more calls audited for
     newer agents and agents with previous low scores
   - Selection is done manually — Smita picks recording IDs from Ameyo reports

2. QUALITY SCORECARD
   Smita showed the scorecard template (Excel):
   Columns: Agent Name, Agent ID, Call Date, Recording ID, Customer Name, Account Number,
   Call Category, Q1-Q15 (scoring parameters), Total Score, Comments

   Scoring parameters include:
   Q1: Greeting and introduction
   Q2: Verification of customer identity
   Q3: Listening skills
   Q4: Product knowledge
   Q5: Accuracy of information provided
   Q6: Script adherence
   Q7: Handling of sensitive information (do they avoid reading out full PAN/account?)
   Q8: Professionalism
   Q9: Resolution provided
   Q10: Call closure and next steps
   Q11-Q15: Category-specific parameters

   NOTE: Q7 is interesting — there's a scoring parameter for "handling of sensitive
   information" which suggests awareness that agents shouldn't read out full PAN etc.
   Yet the system shows full PAN without masking. Contradiction between the scorecard
   expectation and the system configuration.

3. SCORECARD STORAGE
   - Excel files on Smita's OneDrive, organized by month
   - Shared with Nikhil monthly via email
   - Individual agent scores shared with Team Leads for coaching

   DATA IN QUALITY TRACKER: ~200-250 audited calls per month, each with customer
   name and account number. Over time, this accumulates into a substantial dataset
   of customer identifiers linked to call quality assessments.

4. TRAINING RECORDS
   Smita also maintains training records for new hires:
   - Training attendance, topics covered, assessment scores
   - New hires go through 2 weeks of classroom training before going live on calls
   - Training materials include sample call scripts, objection handling guides, product
     knowledge documents
   - No customer data used in training (they use dummy data for role plays)
   - This is a positive finding — no real customer data in training.

== WHATSAPP VERIFICATION ==

Asked Farhan to show the WhatsApp setup:
- Two Samsung phones, company-issued
- WhatsApp Business app installed
- Business profile shows company name and customer care number
- Chat history visible going back several months
- Customers send: text messages, screenshots of payment confirmations, photos of
  property documents, PAN card images (when asked for ID verification over chat)

CRITICAL: Customers are sending PAN card images over WhatsApp. These images are stored
on the phone with no encryption beyond WhatsApp's E2E encryption.

Phones are not MDM-managed (confirmed with Farhan, who checked with IT over chat during
our session).

== EXCEL/ONEDRIVE STORAGE ==

Compliance Calling data structure on Deepa's OneDrive (verified via screen share in
previous session, confirming here):

Compliance_Calling/
  ├── Daily_Sheets/
  │   ├── 2024-04/
  │   │   ├── CC_Daily_01Apr2024.xlsx
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── 2026-01/
  │       ├── CC_Daily_13Jan2026.xlsx
  │       └── ...
  └── Monthly_Consolidated/
      ├── CC_Consolidated_Apr2024.xlsx
      ├── ...
      └── CC_Consolidated_Dec2025.xlsx

Each daily sheet contains 15-30 rows (one per call).
Each monthly consolidated sheet: 300-500 rows.
Total estimated rows across all files: ~8,000-10,000 customer records with PII.

== CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER ASSESSMENT ==

Based on systems identified:
1. Salesforce — Instance location unknown. Need to check with IT. Salesforce typically
   hosts Indian customers on Indian instances but not guaranteed.
2. Ameyo — Vendor claims India hosting. Unverified.
3. WhatsApp — Meta's servers. Data likely processed outside India. WhatsApp Business
   terms may include international data transfer clauses.
4. Microsoft 365 (shared mailbox) — Same question as HR department. Tenant data
   residency needs verification.

NOTE: At minimum, WhatsApp is almost certainly a cross-border transfer. The company is
using WhatsApp Business to handle customer financial inquiries, and Meta processes data
globally.

== SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS FROM THIS SESSION ==

1. Aadhaar numbers (full, unmasked) visible to all 45 CC staff — NOT previously known
2. Co-applicant PAN and Aadhaar also fully visible
3. No field-level security in Salesforce — all profiles have identical read access
4. Salesforce data export with no DLP — full customer database exportable to CSV
5. Ameyo recordings: no retention policy, no confirmed India hosting, ~2 years stored
6. Ameyo recording links embedded in Salesforce cases — bypasses Ameyo access controls
7. Quality scorecard acknowledges sensitive data handling but system doesn't enforce it
8. WhatsApp phones: not MDM-managed, customers sending PAN images, no backup policy
9. WhatsApp is almost certainly a cross-border data transfer via Meta
10. Compliance calling data: ~10,000 rows of customer PII in personal OneDrive
11. Case descriptions contain deeply sensitive free-text (health, corruption, family)

--- NOTES END ---

Next Steps:
  - Compile consolidated data inventory for Customer Care vertical
  - Cross-reference with Salesforce field-level security documentation
  - Verify Ameyo hosting location (request vendor documentation)
  - Verify Salesforce instance location
  - Verify M365 data residency
  - Draft Data Matrix rows for AI pipeline testing
  - Present preliminary findings to Nikhil Joshi for factual review
