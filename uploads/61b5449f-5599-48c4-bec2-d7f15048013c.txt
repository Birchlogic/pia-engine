--- NOTES BEGIN ---

PURPOSE: Hands-on walkthrough of systems and storage locations to verify data inventory
compiled from Sessions 1-4. Sunita walked me through the HRIS and Kavitha showed me the
physical filing system and shared drive structure.

== HRIS WALKTHROUGH (greytHR) ==

Sunita logged into greytHR and showed me the following modules:

1. EMPLOYEE MASTER DATA MODULE
   - Fields observed: Employee ID, Full Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Father's Name,
     Mother's Name, Spouse Name, Marital Status, Blood Group, Nationality, Religion,
     Aadhaar Number, PAN Number, UAN (Universal Account Number for PF), ESI Number,
     Passport Number (optional), Driving License Number, Current Address, Permanent Address,
     Personal Email, Personal Phone, Emergency Contact (Name, Relationship, Phone),
     Date of Joining, Department, Designation, Grade, Reporting Manager, Location/Branch
   - NOTE: greytHR stores Aadhaar and PAN as plain text fields. No masking.
   - NOTE: Religion field is populated. This is sensitive personal data under DPDPA.
     Asked Sunita why religion is collected. She said "it was in the system when we
     configured it. I think it might be for leave eligibility — some holidays are
     religion-specific." This needs review — collecting religion may not be necessary.
   - Active employees: ~1,200. Separated employees still visible: ~400+.

2. PAYROLL MODULE
   - Contains full CTC structure per employee: Basic, HRA, Special Allowance, Conveyance,
     Medical Allowance, LTA, PF (Employer + Employee), ESI, Professional Tax, TDS
   - Bank account number and IFSC code stored here
   - Monthly payroll runs visible with full breakdowns
   - Payslips generated as PDFs — employees can access their own payslips through
     employee self-service portal
   - NOTE: Self-service portal access is via employee ID + password. No MFA.

3. LEAVE MODULE
   - Leave balances, applications, approvals
   - Medical leave applications sometimes have doctor's notes attached as file uploads
   - NOTE: Doctor's notes are health data. Stored in cloud with no separate access control.

4. DOCUMENTS MODULE
   - Employee documents can be uploaded and stored per employee record
   - Observed: Aadhaar copies, PAN copies, offer letters, appointment letters
   - NOT ALL employees have documents uploaded. Kavitha confirmed that upload is
     inconsistent — "we upload when we have time, but there's always a backlog."
   - Older employees who were migrated from Excel don't have documents in the system at all.

== ONEDRIVE FOLDER STRUCTURE ==

Kavitha showed me the HR Ops shared OneDrive structure:

OBSERVATIONS:
- Folder naming uses real employee names, not IDs. Anyone with folder access can browse
  by name.
- OneDrive sharing: Kavitha confirmed the HR_Operations folder is shared with all 6 team
  members. There's no subfolder-level restriction.
- Insurance/Claims contains hospital bills, diagnostic reports, discharge summaries.
  This is SENSITIVE HEALTH DATA stored alongside general HR documents with no additional
  access controls.
- CIBIL reports in individual employee folders contain credit scores and financial data.
- Payroll input files contain bank account numbers. Historical files going back 2 years.

== PHYSICAL FILE ROOM ==

Kavitha took me to the physical filing room (small room adjacent to HR office).

- Metal filing cabinets, 4 units, each with 4 drawers
- Files organized by department, then alphabetically by employee name
- Each file is a manila folder containing: printed offer letter, printed personal details
  form, photocopies of Aadhaar, PAN, education certificates, physical photographs,
  health declaration form (original signed copy), any correspondence
- Storeroom in basement contains older files (pre-2023). Kavitha says "about 15-20 boxes."
  Nobody has inventoried the storeroom in at least 2 years.
- Filing room is locked. HR Ops team members have the key. No visitor log.
- No fire suppression or climate control in the filing room.
- Storeroom in basement is not locked. Kavitha: "Anyone in the building could technically
  walk in. It's just a storage room."

== INSURANCE DATA DEEP DIVE ==

Opened Census_2025-26.xlsx on Sunita's machine.

Columns: Employee ID, Employee Name, DOB, Gender, DOJ, Designation, Location, Annual CTC,
Sum Insured, Policy Type (Individual/Family), Spouse Name, Spouse DOB, Child 1 Name,
Child 1 DOB, Child 2 Name, Child 2 DOB, Father Name, Father DOB, Mother Name, Mother DOB,
Pre-Existing Conditions (Y/N), If Yes - Details, Nominated Relationship

NOTE: "Pre-Existing Conditions - Details" column contains entries like:
  - "Diabetes Type 2, on medication since 2019"
  - "Hypertension, controlled"
  - "Asthma — childhood onset"
  - "Previous knee surgery 2021"

This is detailed health data of employees and their family members sitting in an Excel file
on OneDrive, shared with the full HR Ops team, and emailed to the insurance broker annually.
HIGH RISK finding.

== CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER CHECK ==

Asked Sunita explicitly: Does any employee data leave India?

Sunita: "Not that I'm aware of. greytHR is India-hosted. OneDrive... I think our Microsoft
tenant is India but I'm not certain. Email goes through Microsoft 365 so I suppose the
data is wherever Microsoft stores it. But we don't intentionally send data outside India."

NOTE: Need to verify Microsoft 365 tenant data residency with IT team. If M365 data is
stored outside India, that's a cross-border transfer for ALL email and OneDrive data,
which is essentially ALL HR data.

== SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS FROM THIS SESSION ==

1. greytHR stores Aadhaar and PAN as unmasked plain text
2. Religion data collected — possibly unnecessary
3. ~400 separated employee records with no archival/deletion timeline
4. Self-service portal has no MFA
5. Doctor's notes (health data) stored in leave module without additional access controls
6. OneDrive folder structure exposes all employee data to entire HR Ops team
7. Insurance census with health data in shared folder and emailed to external party
8. Claims folder contains hospital records — highly sensitive, broadly accessible
9. Physical files: filing room has minimal security, storeroom is UNLOCKED
10. No inventory of storeroom contents
11. Microsoft 365 data residency needs verification for cross-border assessment
12. Payroll files with bank details stored historically with no purge cycle

--- NOTES END ---

Next Steps:
  - Compile consolidated data inventory for HR vertical
  - Cross-reference all findings with DPDPA requirements
  - Draft Data Matrix rows for AI pipeline testing
  - Coordinate with IT team for M365 data residency verification
  - Present preliminary findings to Meena Sharma for factual review
